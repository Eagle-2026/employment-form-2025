# Employment Form 2025

## About the Project

The Employment Form 2025 is a modern web app made with React and Tailwind CSS. It lets users fill out an employment application step by step with a clean and easy-to-use interface.

This project shows my skills in frontend development, including:

1- Multi-page navigation using react-router-dom

2- Managing form data across pages with React Context API

3- Saving data in localStorage so users can continue later

4- Using reusable components for consistent design and easier updates

5- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS for both mobile and desktop

6- Pages to review and confirm data before submitting

This project is perfect for showing my skills in React, component structure, routing, state management, and styling.
