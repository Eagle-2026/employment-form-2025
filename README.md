# Employment Form 2025

## About the Project

The **Employment Form 2025** is a modern, multi-step web application built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS** that allows users to fill out an employment application in a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface.

This project demonstrates best practices in frontend development, including:

- **Multi-page navigation** with `react-router-dom`
- **State management** using React Context API to manage form data across pages
- **Persistent data storage** with `localStorage` so users can continue where they left off
- **Reusable components** for consistent UI and easier maintenance
- **Responsive design** using Tailwind CSS for mobile and desktop support
- **Review and confirmation** pages to verify data before final submission

It’s an ideal **portfolio project** to showcase skills in React, component architecture, routing, state management, and frontend styling.
