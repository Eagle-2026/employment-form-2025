# Employment Form 2025

## About the Project

The Employment Form 2025 is a modern web app made with React and Tailwind CSS. It lets users fill out an employment application step by step with a clean and easy-to-use interface.

This project shows my skills in frontend development, including:

Multi-page navigation using react-router-dom

Managing form data across pages with React Context API

Saving data in localStorage so users can continue later

Using reusable components for consistent design and easier updates

Responsive design with Tailwind CSS for both mobile and desktop

Pages to review and confirm data before submitting

This project is perfect for showing my skills in React, component structure, routing, state management, and styling.
